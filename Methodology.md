1. Data Preparation:

- Ensure that your dataset includes the operating cash flow to capex values for each stock over the past 20 years.
- Verify that the data is clean, and there are no missing or erroneous entries.
2. Ranking Stocks:

- For each year, rank your stocks based on the operating cash flow to capex ratio.
- You want to sort them in ascending order so that companies with higher ratios come first (considering you want high cash flow relative to capex in the top quintile).
3. Quintile Assignment:

- Divide the ranked list into quintiles (five equal parts). The top 20% will be your top quintile, the next 20% the second quintile, and so on.
- Ensure that you're consistent with the assignment across all years.
4. Portfolio Formation:

- For each year, create portfolios for each quintile based on the ranked stocks.
- Your top quintile portfolio should include companies with the highest operating cash flow to capex ratios.
5. Performance Analysis:

- Calculate the average performance metrics (returns, excess returns, etc.) for each quintile over one-year and rolling three-year periods.
- Compare the performance of the top quintile to the bottom quintile to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy.
6. Sector-Level Analysis (Optional):

- If you're interested in sector-level analysis, you can perform the same process for each economic sector, as mentioned in your strategy.
7. Visualization (Optional):

- Create visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to represent the performance of each quintile over time.
8. Backtesting Validation:

- Validate your strategy by checking if the outperformance or underperformance aligns with the expectations outlined in your initial strategy description.
Remember to consider the potential impact of outliers or extreme values in your data. Also, check for any significant changes in the market environment over the 20-year period that might have influenced the results.

This process should help you organize your universe into quintiles based on the operating cash flow to capex ratio and evaluate the performance of your strategy.
