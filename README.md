## Preliminary analysis
- WHAT MAKES A STOCK PRICE APPRECIATE?
  - A stock price is simply an earnings metric multiplied by a multiple metric. The most common ways to value a stock are P/E (price/earnings), EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/EBITDA) and FCF/Market Capitalization (or Free Cash Flow yield)
  - If a stock price is increasing, it is either being driven by higher earnings or multiple expansion. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $10, and earns $1 per share in EPS, it is trading at 10x earnings.
- For a company to be considered a good investment, solid earnings are essential
  - Look at y-o-y or q-o-q results
- ROE - Return on investment
  - Net Income/Shareholder's Equity
  - Measures the ability of a company's management to turn a profit
